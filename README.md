# Easona
Capstone Project for ECE454

Easona (Ease of Navigation)
Easona is a navigational app that hopes to combine a variety of features to allow a seamless experience.

The motivation of the project was based off a team member who experienced how Google maps lacked considerations to the weather and storm for navigation.

The baseline for the project will stay true to the motivation and accomadate weather forecast capabilities alongside Google Maps navigation. Especially for the duration of the course ECE454, we aim to complete the baseline features first. For scalability potential and future growth, we hope to implement features found by surveying Trucking forums and Trucking websites, where we found that Truckers were using a large multitude of apps for very specific features. We hope to implement these specific features alongside our baseline app and allow a seamless experience for traveling and navigation.
